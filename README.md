# MY DATA ANALYSIS JOURNEY
---
## INTRODUCTION

I am a biomedical science researcher with a BSc (Hons) degree in Microbiology, MSc in Biomedical Science and a PhD in view.

Before I enrolled on the Data Analysis course administered by Ladies In Tech Africa and the Incubator Hub, I could not do much with Microsoft Excel other than input data in the most basic form and save it.

Although I was enrolled on a PhD in Bioinformatics, for a long time in the course, I focused too much on the wet laboratory aspect of the project (this was and is my strength), and I was waiting patiently for the sequenced data from my project before I start concentrating on how to solve the downstream analysis of the project or better still outsource it if or once I encounter any challenge.

## FAILURE - A PIVOT TO SUCCESS

The project never attained that satge of downstream analysis as it encountered a major setback and was dismissed.

Also, because of my shallow knowledge of data science and analysis, I could not do any work with datasets readily available online as I practically didn't know what to do or how to go about doing it, thus, I couldn't be a bioinformatician as I anticipated.

## THE AWAKENING

While waiting to enrol on a new PhD program, I started to look for a job and realized that most of the jobs I desired had a connect with data analysis and as such, getting a job delayed.

Note that the new PhD program will also require me to have data analysis skills, so whether
