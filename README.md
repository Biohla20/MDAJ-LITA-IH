My Data Analysis Journey - LITA - Incubator Hub

# MY DATA ANALYSIS JOURNEY
---
## INTRODUCTION
I am a biomedical science researcher with a BSc (Hons) degree in Microbiology, MSc in Biomedical Science and a PhD in view.

Before I enrolled on the Data Analysis course administered by Ladies In Tech Africa and the Incubator Hub, I could not do much with Microsoft Excel other than input data in the most basic form and save it.

Although I was enrolled on a PhD in Bioinformatics, for a long time in the course, I focused too much on the wet laboratory aspect of the project (this was and is my strength), and I was waiting patiently for the sequenced data from my project before I start concentrating on how to solve the downstream analysis of the project or better still outsource it if or once I encounter any challenge.

## FAILURE - A PIVOT TO SUCCESS
The project never attained that satge of downstream analysis as it encountered a major setback and was dismissed.

Also, because of my 'zero' knowledge of data science and analysis, I could not do any work with datasets that are readily available online as I practically didn't know what to do or how to go about doing it, thus, I couldn't be a bioinformatician as I anticipated.

## THE AWAKENING
While waiting to enrol on a new PhD program, I started to look for a job and realized that most of the jobs I desired had a connect with data analysis and as such, getting a job delayed.

Note that the new PhD program will also require me to have data analysis skills, so whether I get myself the dream job or an educational placement, I need to be skilled with data analysis.

In order to equip myself for the tasks ahead, I was close to paying for a data analysis course when the information about LITA-Incubator hub was circulated, and I did not hesistate to take that opportunity, I am very glad I did.

## STEP BY STEP
The LITA course (data analysis) have been a tremendous blessing to my career path. The step by step and detailed teachings are outstanding. The course started with Microsoft Excel, to SQL(Structured Query Language) and then Microsoft PowerBI. Below is a flow-through of each segment of the course so far.
### - Microsoft Excel
  1. Basics of data analysis
  2. Excel interface and navigation
  3. Data entry in Excel
  4. Excel functions
  5. Reporting with pivot tables and charts
### - SQL
  1. Introduction to SQL
  2. Writing SQL queries
  3. SQL clauses
  4. SQL operators
  5. SQL views
  6. SQL case when
### - Portfolio building (GitHub set-up)
### - Microsoft PowerBI
  1. Introduction and installation
  2. Data entry and connecting to data sources
  3. PowerBI fundamentals
  4. Power query for data transformation
  5. Data analysis expression function
  6. Data analysis expression function 2
  7. PowerBI and Data visualization
  8. Data visualization continued
  9. To be continued...

## CURRENT STATE
By the day, I am becoming very confident with the use of Excel, SQL and PowerBI. All of the things that didn't make sense to me when I took the Bioinformatics Introductory course such as Python for Biologist, R, JupyterLab, GitHub, and Galaxy now makes perfect sense.

I am hoping to improve on all tools and platforms as the days pass by and hope to become a guru data analyst and informatician soon.

I am open to internship for continuous hands-on knowledge of the things I am learning. I am also open to becoming a teaching assistant for the next LITA training knowing that the more I teach it the more I have a grasp of it.

## Pictorial expression of current state 
Understanding = The grasp of data analysis 

LITA Course = The progression of data analysis course

Enthusiasm = Eagerness to attend classes, finish the course well, and take over the world of data analysis
